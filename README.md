# Carrot on Cloud

Carrot on Cloud is a browser extension and backend system that displays performance analytics for Codeforces contests directly on the standings page.  
It centralizes contest computation to eliminate redundant API calls and serve consistent results to all users.
Performance analytics includes metrics such as rating change estimations, relative performance, and contest-based comparisons derived from official Codeforces contest data.


## Why this project exists

Codeforces contest analytics are typically computed per user, leading to redundant API calls and unnecessary load.  
Carrot on Cloud computes contest data once per contest and distributes the results efficiently to all clients.

## Key Optimization

- Reduces Codeforces API calls from O(n) (per user) to O(1) (single shared call)
- Contest results are cached to avoid recomputation

## Overview

- **Frontend**: Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that runs on `codeforces.com` and injects a **Performance** column into standings/results tables.
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express server responsible for fetching, computing, and serving contest analytics.
- **Database**: MySQL used to cache contest results and computed metrics.
## High-Level Architecture

## How It Works

1. The Chrome extension extracts the contest ID and user handle from the Codeforces standings page.
2. The extension sends a request to the backend with the contest ID and required metadata.
3. The backend checks whether analytics for the contest already exist in the database.
4. If cached data exists, it is returned immediately.
5. Otherwise, the backend fetches contest data from the Codeforces API, computes performance metrics, stores the results in MySQL, and returns the response.
6. The extension injects the computed performance data into the standings UI.
